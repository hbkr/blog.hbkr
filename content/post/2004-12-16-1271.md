大発見しましたのでご報告いたします！
「ですが、なにか？」を文章の末尾につけると二ちゃんネラーぽくなります！
以下、例文
I still remember,
The ways that you touched me.
Now I know I don't mean anything to you.
You're Easy Breezy, and I'm Japan-ezy.
Soon you'll mean exactly nothing to me.
And that means…
You look stupid,
Telling all your friends how you got the best of me.
I intended to share the pleasure, only now I look stupid.
We're living in a world with a lot of pressure,
It's quite un-needed to put more pressure on me.
You came and went, and left my house like a breeze just passing by.
Hello, goodbye, you left a note saying, “’T’was nice stopping by.”
I should have never, ever let you inside. ですが、なにか？
ほら、ね！
